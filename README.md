# Tensorflow-Implementation-of-Triple-GAN
This is a tensorflow re-implementation for tirple-GAN. 

The code is used in ["Semi-supervised learning based on generative adversarial network: a comparison between good GAN and bad GAN approach"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/Weakly%20Supervised%20Learning%20for%20Real-World%20Computer%20Vision%20Applications/Li_Semi-supervised_learning_based_on_generative_adversarial_network_a_comparison_between_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf).
It is constructed based on the author's original [code](https://github.com/zhenxuan00/triple-gan) and the other tensorflow
implementation [here](https://github.com/taki0112/TripleGAN-Tensorflow).

We haven't put too much effort on refactoring the code as it is still an ongoing project. Feel free to leave your comments and 
suggestions in this repo.
